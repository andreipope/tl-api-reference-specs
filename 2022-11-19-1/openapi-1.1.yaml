  title: Twelve Labs Video Understanding API
  description: |
    Use the Twelve Labs Video Understanding API to extract information from your videos and make it available to your applications. The API is organized around REST and returns responses in the JSON format. It is compatible with most programming languages, and you can also use Postman or other REST clients to send requests and view responses.

    ## Call an Endpoint
    
    To call an endpoint, you must construct a URL similar to the following one:
    ```
    {Method} {BaseURL}/{version}/{resource}/{path_parameters}?{query_parameters}
    ```

    The list below describes each component of a request:
    - **Method**: The API supports the following methods:
      - `GET`: Reads data.
      - `POST`: Creates a new object or performs an action.
      - `PUT`: Updates an object.
      - `DELETE`: Deletes an object.
      
      Note that the `POST` and `PUT` methods require you to pass a request body containing additional parameters.
    - **Base URL**: The base URL of the API is https://api.twelvelabs.io.
    - **Version:** To use the `v1.1` version of the API, it must be set to `v1.1`.
    - **Resource**: The name of the resource you want to interact with.
    - **Path Parameters**: Allow you to indicate a specific object. For example, you can retrieve details about an engine or index. 
    - **Query Parameters**: Any parameters that an endpoint accepts. For example, you can filter or sort a response using query parameters.
    Note that the API requires you to pass a header parameter containing your API key to authenticate each request. For details, see the [Authentication](/docs/guides-authentication) page.


    ## Responses

    Twelve Labs Video Understanding API follows the [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html) standard to indicate the success or failure of a request.

    Each response contains a field named `X-Api-Version` that indicates the version of the API against which the operation was performed.

    ### HTTP Status Codes

    The following list is a summary of the HTTP status codes returned by the API:
    - `200`: The request was successful.
    - `201`: The request was successful and a new resource was created.
    - `401`: The API key you provided is not valid. Note that, for security reasons, your API key automatically expires every two months. When your key has expired, you must generate a new one to continue using the API. For details, see the [Authentication](/docs/guides-authentication) page.
    - `404`: The requested resource was not found.

    ### Errors

    HTTP status codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error caused by the parameters you provided in the request. For more details, see the [Error Codes](/reference/error-codes) page. For each error, the API service returns the following fields in the body of the response:
    - `code`: A string representing the error code.
    - `message`: A human-readable string describing the error, intended to be suitable for display in a user interface.
    - `docs_url`: The URL of the relevant documentation page.
    For more details, see [Error Codes](/reference/error-codes) page.

      summary: Create a Video Indexing Task
      description: |
        Use this method to create a new video indexing task that uploads a video to the API service and makes it searchable. Note the following about creating a new video indexing task:
        - To upload a file that resides on the local file system, pass the `video_file` parameter. It must be a stream of bytes encoded as `multipart/form-data`.
        - To upload a file from a publicly accessible URL, pass the `video_url` parameter with the URL of your video. It must be a `string`.
        - You must specify at least one of the `video_file` and `video_url` parameters. If you specify both the `video_url` and `video_file` parameters in the same request, the `video_url` parameter takes precedence over `video_file`.
        - To provide a transcription file, you must set the `provide_transcription` parameter to `true` and specify at least one of the `transcription_file` and `transcription_url` parameters:
          - Use the `transcription_file` parameter to provide a transcription from the local file system. It must be a stream of bytes encoded as `multipart/form-data`.
          - Use the `transcription_url` parameter to provide a transcription file from a publicly accessible URL. It must be a `string`.

            Twelve Labs currently offers three different indexing options: `visual`, `conversation`, and `text_in_video`. For more details, see the [Indexing Options](/docs/concepts-indexing-options) page.

            **NOTES**:
            - The indexing options cannot be changed once the index has been created.
            - The types of searches you can perform on this index are a subset of the indexing options.

    videoIndexingTask:
      title: Video Indexing Task
      description: |
        A task represents a request to upload and index a video. A task starts when you begin uploading your video by calling the **POST** method of the `tasks` endpoint, and it can have one of the following statuses:
        - **Validating**: Your video has finished uploading, and the API service is validating it by performing the following checks:
          - Resolution must be greater or equal than 360p and less than 1080p (FHD).
          - Duration must be between 10 seconds and 2 hours (7,200s).
          - Your video must contain an audio track.
          - Your video must not have missing frames.
        - **Pending**: The API is spawning a new worker server to process your video.
        - **Indexing**: The API is transforming the video you uploaded into vectors. A vector is like a compressed version of the video and contains all the information that Twelve Labs' deep-learning models need to perform fast, semantic, accurate, and scalable searches.
        - **Ready**: Your video is ready to be searched.
        Additionally, you may receive one of the following error messages:
        - **Broken Video File**: Your video has broken frame(s) or does not contain an audio track.
        - **Failed**: The API service encountered an internal error, and the video indexing task failed.
        The `task` object has the following elements:
      type: object
      properties:
        _id:
          type: string
          description: |

          description: |
            A string indicating the date and time, in the RFC 3339 format, that the task object was last updated. The API service updates this field every time the video indexing task transitions to a different state.

    videoVector:
      type: object
      title: Video Vector
      description: |
        When the API service indexes a video, it doesn't store it. Instead, the API service saves all the required information needed to perform fast, semantic, accurate, and scalable searches as lists of floating numbers. These lists are named video vectors.

        The `video_vector` object has the following elements:
        - `_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of a video. The API service creates a new `video_vector` object and assigns it a unique identifier when the video has successfully been indexed, and it's ready to be searched. Note that video IDs are different from task IDs.
        - `created_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the video indexing task was created.
        - `indexed_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the video has finished indexing.
        - `metadata`: An object that contains the following information about the video:
          - `duration`
          - `filename`
          - `fps`
          - `height`
          - `size`

                description: |
                  Search options specify the source of information the API service uses when performing a search. The following values are supported:
                  - `visual`: Allows you to search by objects, actions, sound, movements, places, situational events, and complex audio-visual text descriptions.
                  - `conversation`: Allows you to find the exact point in your video where the specified word or phrase is mentioned.
                  - `text_in_video`: Allows you to search for text that appears in your videos (OCR).

                  The search options you specify must be a subset of the indexing options used when you created the index.
                  You can specify multiple search options in conjunction with the `operator` parameter described below to broaden or narrow your search.
              operator:
                type: string
                description: |
                  When you specify more than one search option, you can use this parameter to indicate the logical operation that the API service should perform.
                    
                    The following logical operators are supported:
                    
                    - `or`: The API returns the results for which any search option matches.
                    
                    - `and`: The API returns only the results for which all search options match.

                    For details and examples, see the [Multiple Search Options](/docs/guides-multiple-search-options) page.

                    
                    **Default**: `or`.

                  Specifies the type of search the API service will perform. The following values are supported:
                  - `semantic`: The API service returns results that are semantically similar to the search query even if the results don't exactly match the search query.
                  - `transcription`: The API service returns only the exact matches. Note that `transcription` can only be used with a single search option. For example, you cannot set the `search_option parameter` to equal `["visual", "conversation", "text_in_video"]` and the `conversation_option` parameter to equal `transcription`.

                  **Default**: `semantic`.

              filter:
                type: object
                description: |
                  For string fields, the filter `parameter` returns only the results that equal the value you specify. The following example filters on the videos whose title is "Animal Encounters part 1": `"title": "Animal Encounters part 1"`.
                  
                  For numeric fields, the `filter` parameter returns the results that match based on the arithmetic comparison. The following example filters on the videos whose height is greater than or equal to 400 and less than or equal to 500: `"height": { "gte": 400, "lte": 500 }`.

                  You can also filter by any of the custom fields specified by invoking the `PUT` method of the `/indexes/:index-id/videos/:video-id` endpoint.  The following example returns only the videos for which a custom field named `needsReview` of type `boolean` is set to `true`: `"needs_review": true`.
